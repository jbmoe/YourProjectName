# C# Project Quickstart Template

This is a simple solution template that can be used to get started with a new C# project quickly. It provides a basic structure and setup for a C# project, allowing you to focus on writing your code instead of spending time on the initial setup.

## Project Structure

The template contains the following files and directories:

- `src/`: This directory is where you will place your C# project files.

- `tests/`: This directory is where you can add unit tests for your project.

- `YourProjectName.sln`: This is the solution file that ties together all the projects in the solution.

- `Directory.Build.props`: This file allows you to customize the build process by specifying common properties for all projects within the solution.

- `.editorconfig`: This file provides a consistent coding style across different editors and IDEs by defining code formatting rules.

- `.gitignore`: This file specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git, preventing them from being tracked or committed.

- `IceCreamPablo.ruleset`: This file contains a set of code analysis rules that help maintain code quality and consistency.

- `stylecop.json`: This file is a configuration file for StyleCop, a tool that enforces a set of coding style and consistency rules.

- `CHANGELOG.md`: This is a changelog template. Use if applicable or delete.

- `LICENSE.txt`: Sample MIT license file. Use if applicable or delete.

## Getting Started

To use this template, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the solution file (`YourProjectName.sln`) in your preferred IDE or text editor. This template is compatible with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.

3. Review the project structure:
   - `src/` directory: This is where you will place your C# project files.
   - `tests/` directory: This is where you can add unit tests for your project.
   - `YourProjectName.sln` file: This is the solution file that ties together all the projects in the solution.

4. Rename the solution file (`YourProjectName.sln`) to match your project's name. Use CTRL+SHIFT+F for finding all occurences of **YourProjectName**

5. Start writing your C# code in the `src/` directory. You can organize your code into classes and namespaces based on your project's requirements.

6. If you want to add unit tests, place them in the `tests/` directory. You can use popular testing frameworks like NUnit or XUnit.

7. Build and run your project using your IDE's build and run commands.

8. Customize the template to fit your project's needs. You can modify the project structure, add additional projects, or configure project settings as required.

9. Enjoy coding!
